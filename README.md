# epithelial_spheroids
Semi-automated analysis of epithelial spheroid polarity in 3D culture

To perform spheroid classification, the analysis tool examines a number of descriptive shape parameters and the distributions of different fluorescent marker signals in the equatorial plane of epithelial cell spheroids. The ImageJ / FIJI macro spheroids.ijm processes original images and determines shape parameters, feeding the MATLAB scripts OpenFolder.m and readstack.m with all information needed for further analysis. To allow adaption of the tool to variable assay conditions and / or markers, a classification tree is trained using the "Classification Learner App" and a subset of manually classified spheroids. The bulk of spheroids is analysed by the script Classification.m in an automated fashion based on the results file of OpenFolder.m, which contains a set of 15 parameters for each spheroid, and the trained classification tree. 

Example image files and exemplary set of decision trees are available at:

ImageJ / FIJI macros were developed using the ImageJ version 2.0.0-rc-59/1.51k packaged in the FIJI distribution. MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.; Natick, MA, United States) scripts were implemented in version R2015b (Version 8.6- 3 Sep 2015). ImageJ macros were written to process Zeiss Vision Image ".zvi" or Tagged Image File ".tif" formats with a resolution of 0.1625 Âµm per pixel (typical size, 256 x 256 pixels for each plane and color). A different scale of the images may require adaptation of pixel values in spheroids.ijm. Usage of the bio-formats FIJI plugin allows adaption to other image formats. For training of the decision tree and usage of trained classifiers in MATLAB analysis with Classification Learner App, the "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox" is required. Furthermore, in MATLAB the cell2string function is needed to extract the image names from the files list.
